Hardware [SENS]
---------------
Sensor-device with "light-to-voltage" converter used to count pulses on a
energy meter similar to this:

The TSL257 is fastened over the impulse diode with "McGyver tape" to avoid
stray light and to ensure secure fastening. The Arduino and Xbee is located
outside the "fusebox" and a regular 4-wire telephone cable is used to connect
the TSL257 to the Arduino (3 wires).

Hardware [LAMP]
---------------
Any LAMP server - could be a Synology NAS (my setup) or e.g. a Amazon EC2
server (small ... free for a year). 
	
Revision History
================
29.02.2012	Added MySQL support. web/sql*.php is called from index.php
			Added Xbee to Ethernet GW
05.02.2012	Revised web pages to dynamically update without reload - still rough 
          	but closer...
01.02.2012	Added web pages in php using Google Chart. Inspired by code created 
          	by https://github.com/HNygard
01.02.2012	Initial version - experimental level - all input highly appreciated

To-do
=====
*	Revise SENS to send "correct" syntax to the GW. Now the transform to save
	data to the MySQL db is done in the GW and it should be transparent.
*	Revise SENS to employ /utc/ time broadcast by ENGW and timestamp reports
*	Really need to add DHCP and DNS support for the GW to avoid hardcoded IPs
*	lots more...

Known issues
============
*	When computer sleeps and resumes, page should reload to catch up the line-
	graph - now it just continues multiple reads is hogging memory and cpu on 
	my LAMP server (Synology 411j) - should only parse new stuff since last
	load and update graphs
*	If there's not enough data last 24 hours, the graph doesn't grow. The same
	number of data points is kept, should grow until 24 hours total is reached.
